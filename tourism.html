				   That’s true in many ways. History stays awake in this destination and the sprawling urban centre that Madurai is, offers you all the conveniences you will love for a comfortable stay. 
				   The earliest references of Madurai can be traced back to the 3rd century BC</p>

				<p> The best place to start your journey is the magnificent Ayyanar falls at Rajapalayam. 
				Cool off in the quaint ambience and relax as much as you want at Ayyanar falls. Hemmed in by dense forest, you can’t ask for a quieter place to unwind. 
				Head off to Sathuragiri hills at Srivilliputhur which is also known as Siddhargal bhoomi. Legend has it that it used to be the abode of 18 Siddhas. 
				Make sure you choose the right day for visit because the public are allowed only six days in a month. Visit the popular Andal Kovil at Srivilliputhur, regarded as one of the oldest Hindu temples. Ancient drawings and sculptures add to the appeal of this temple.
				Mariamman Temple, one of the oldest temples in Tamil Nadu is also a key tourist spot. Pilavakkal dam makes for an excellent choice and when you fill in all the major places, it’s time for shopping. 
				No matter how much you explore, the markets at Sivakasi, Rajapalayam and Kasu Kadai Bazaar keep throwing surprises at you. 
				Jam Packed with diverse items, these markets never fail to catch the fancy of a shopper. The place prides itself as an important trade center of dry chillies, cotton, groundnut oil, cotton goods, jaggery, coriander seeds, peppers, and grains, why don't you explore a few when you are here? </p>
